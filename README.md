## The Purpose of the Challenge 

### The challenge was to create a VBA script and Arrays to compare two stocks from two different years, 2017 and 2018. When working with VBA, I ensure everything is neat and organized, and I do not change any of the information in excel. I also confirmed that the script looped through the stock data and read all the values it provided. 

## Results

## Advantages and Disadgvantages 

### There were a few advantages and disadvantages of refactoring the code.  The benefits were I had all the information I needed from the challenge; excel ensured I had to organize and create tickers and loops. The disadvantages of refactoring the code were making sure you do not change the code, but due to circumstances, you may have to change some things to line up everything.
